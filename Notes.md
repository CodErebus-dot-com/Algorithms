# Big-O Guide:

## Calculation not dependent on input size - O(1)
## Loop - O(n)
## Nested loops - O(n,2)
## Input size reduced by half - O(logn)

> Optimized Primality Test: If n = a * b then, one of the factors (a, b) is less than or equal to square root of n. Hence, integers larger than the square root of n do not need to be checked.
> In Binary a number that is a power of 2 except for 1, ends with 0.
